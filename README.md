# Music Project
For this project, you will be using React to show the albums of your favorite artist.

## What to do
You will need to use the [iTunes JSON API](https://affiliate.itunes.apple.com/resources/documentation/itunes-store-web-service-search-api/) to grab the albums of an artist.

Then, display the albums on a React page. For each album you will need to display:
* Artist Name
* Album Name
* Year Released
* Album Art

 Feel free to be creative on how you display and style the albums. You may want to include any extra metadata that you find useful.
